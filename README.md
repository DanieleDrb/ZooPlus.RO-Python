# ZooPlus.RO-Python
So I made a mini-project for automated testing of Zooplus.ro website using SELENIUM WEBDRIVER and PYTEST framework.
The goal of the project was to automate the testing process of creating a pet profile on this website.
I adopted the Page Object Model to organize and structure the code in an efficient way.
